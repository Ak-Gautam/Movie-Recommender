## Movie-Recommender
### A bad way to do things
This is a Movie Recommender based on the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).<hr>
This whole project is very heavy on the Memory as workingwith a lot of text data is expensive on the RAM. <br>

#### Content
This project contains two type of recommenders: 
- Content Based Recommender (plot based)
- Collaborative Filtering (based on director, cast, genres, etc)

#### This is supposed to be a learning technique and not an end-to-end solution.
